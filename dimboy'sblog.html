        <h4>Posted on Tuesday, 12th August, 2025</h4>
        
<p>This Blog is about a young boy on a quest to figure out what to do with his life on his school vacation, something fun and non-monetary but might also earn him some money. That's when I found Khan Academy.</p>

<h2 id="my-history">My History</h2>
<h4><p>Posted on Tuesday, 12th August, 2025 </h4>
<p>It all started when my parents told me I couldn't spend my whole vacation on video games and enlightened me about coding and also said I might be able earn money. At first I wasn't interested but then I decided to give it a shot because:</p>
<ol>
<li>I wanted to earn some money</li>
<li>I didn't have a choice</li>
<li>I didn't have any other thing to do</li>
<li>I wanted to make my parents proud</li>
</ol>

<p>It sounded fun at first and it was.</p>

<h2 id="why-I-chose-khan-academy">Why I chose Khan Academy</h2>
<h4><p>Posted on Tuesday, 12th August, 2025</p></h4>
I actually used Khan Academy before now when I was younger, but I stopped due to the lack of interest and started again years later and forgot how fun it was. 
It started with a simple google search.
I mostly chose Khan Academy because it's a free open source for curious kids like me in search for skills like making websites with code, it turned out to be easy when I started with drawing with code and gradually advanced to HTML and CSS. Overall, I don't think there is any other website I would've chosen other than this.
<h2 id="what-I-have-learned">What I have learned</h2>
<h4>Posted on Tuesday, 12th August, 2025</h4>
<p>I have learned a lot of things on Khan Academy.</p>
The first thing I learned was how to make drawings with code. I started with codes like: ellipse(Circle), rect(Square), line(Line), fill, stroke, strokeweight, etc.
Then I advanced to HTML which is the foundation of webpages and learned that it's mostly all about different tags for different functions, then I learned CSS for styling webpages.
<h2 id="what-I-have-made">What I have made</h2>
<p>I have conquered many challenges and perfected many projects on my journey in Khan Academy but was all worth it to feel like I've spent my vacation wisely. I have made stuff like: drawings, webpages, links to other webpages, customized my own blog, created  my own recipe book, my own travel website and many more. I am currently on Unit 2 Lesson 4 and will go on and keep growing.
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
In conclusion, I would like to thank Pamela for the very helpful and interactive lessons. I recommend Khan Academy because of the fun and user-friendly lessons and assignments, it has really helped me.
